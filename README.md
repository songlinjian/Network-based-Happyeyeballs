# Network-based-Happyeyeballs

During period of IPv6 transition, both ISP and ICP cares about users' experince in dual-stack network. They hesitate to provide IPv6 to their users due to the fear of IPv6 performance. Network-based HE is proposed as a approach to provide better connectivity to end users by measuring and comparing IPv6/IPv4 performance on the network side other than user side (RFC8305). It can work independently with the adoption of client-based HE.

This proposal is a joint work by Xie Chongfeng from China telecom and Davey Song from BII
