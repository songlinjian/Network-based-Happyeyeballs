# Network-side Happy Eyeballs

Abstract

   During period of IPv6 transition, both ISP and ICP cares about user's
   experience in dual-stack network.  They hesitate to provide IPv6 to
   their users due to the fear of poor IPv6 performance.  Network-based
   Happy Eyeballs (NHE) is proposed in this memo as a approach to
   provide better connectivity to end users by doing accurate
   measurement and comparison on IPv6/IPv4 performance on the network
   side other than client-side Happy Eyeballs ([RFC8305]).  It can also
   work independently with the adoption of client-side Happy Eyeballs.
   
   
This proposal is a joint work by Xie Chongfeng from China telecom and Davey Song from BII
